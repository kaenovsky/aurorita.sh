## Aurorita.sh
This is just a fun little project to test printing the output of a shell script into a browser using php popen() function.

[View the result in current deploy](https://aurorita.bash.ar).

Kudos to [Havenard](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20109859) for the output in real time solution, it's a really time consuming trick in order to get it right and after trying a lot of paths popen() was the way to go.
