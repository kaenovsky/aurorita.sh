Kudos to [Havenard](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20109859) for the output in real time solution, it's a really time consuming trick in order to get it right and after trying a lot of paths popen() was the way to go.

If you want to run this you need to [set up a LAMP enviroment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29).
